# thermostat

This is a simple thermostat program that allows a user to increase or decrease the temperature of their thermostat.

# Features include: 
* Power Saving Mode prohibits the user from increasing the temperature above 25 degrees
* If the temperature is above 25 degrees and the user turns PSM on, the thermostat temperature turns itself down to 25 degrees
* User can view their current energy usage (low, medium, high) according to the current temperature

# Tech Stack

I used Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Jest for testing.
